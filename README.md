Genetic Algorithms Project: THE KNAPSACK PROBLEM

You are going on a hiking trip, and there is a limit to the things you can bring. You have two things: a backpack with a size (the weight it can hold that is) and a set of boxes with different weights and different importance values.

The goal is to fill the backpack to make it as valuable as possible without exceeding the maximum weight (250):

Define the problem as a genetic algorithm.
Provide the genome for the problem.
Define all the fringe operations.
Cull your population by 50% at every generation.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the file: python A3_Mapara.py

Generates a plot showing the fitness of fittest indiviudal over 500 generations.
